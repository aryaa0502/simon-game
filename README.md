Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill. It creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails to repeat the exact pattern, the game is over. This game is implemented here using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3.
